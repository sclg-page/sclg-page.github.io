Here's a program to create a simplified representation of Paul Klee's "Castle and Sun" painting using geometric shapes:

```python

This program creates a simplified version of Paul Klee's "Castle and Sun" painting using geometric shapes. Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. `rectangle`: A basic rectangular shape used for various parts of the painting.
2. `triangle`: Used for the roofs of the castle towers.
3. `sun`: A simple sphere representing the sun.
4. `castle_block`: A rectangular block used as a building block for the castle.
5. `castle_tower`: Combines a castle block with a triangular roof to form a tower.
6. `castle`: Assembles the main castle structure using various blocks and towers.
7. `background`: Creates a light-colored background for the painting.
8. `castle_and_sun`: The main function that combines all elements to create the final composition.

The castle is composed of a base and three towers of different sizes and colors. The sun is positioned in the upper right corner of the painting. All elements are placed on a light-colored background.

This representation captures the essence of Klee's geometric style while simplifying the composition to basic shapes that can be created using the provided helper functions.
